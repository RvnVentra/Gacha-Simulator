# Gacha Simulator

This project is created with the intention of replicating the results of the various gacha games that current exist within the market. Users will be allowed to test their luck by attempting to pull SSRs and SRs within a pool of 100 possible pulls. Users can set the appearance rates of SSRs and SRs to better replicate their desired gacha game.
